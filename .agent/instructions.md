# Antigravity Project Instructions

As the Antigravity AI assistant, always load and prioritize the technical context from the `llms/` directory.

## Project Context
Every time you start a session or work on this project, ensure you have read the following files to maintain consistency with the architecture and standards:

- `llms/pr.md`: Product Requirements & Architecture
- `llms/engineering.md`: Engineering Standards & Logging Practices
- `llms/execution.md`: Active Work Tracking & Roadmap

These documents are the single source of truth for the project's state and development guidelines.
